Alias
=====

Alias Plugin for Vanilla Forums shows a list of former user names in the user profile.    
This plugin only makes sense if you allow your users to change their user name. You have to put the line `$Configuration['Garden']['Profile']['EditUsernames'] = TRUE` in your config.php to allow that
